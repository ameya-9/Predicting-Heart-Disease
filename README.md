## Dataset 
 That was referred : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease



## Data contains;

* age - age in years
* sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)
* cp - chest pain type
* trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
* chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
* fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
* restecg - resting electrocardiographic results
* thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
* exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
* oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
* thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
* target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no)

##Aim : To Classify presence of Heart Disease on basis of mentioned features. <br>
In this project , we would classify presence of heart disease on the basis of given features. <br>

## Research Question(s)
  Is there a correlation between thalach (maximum heart rate achivied) , to heart disease and if there is how strong?
  What gender individual are more prone to heart disease ?
